## Introduction

This application is a non-functional UI mockup of a desktop music player UI, similar to the one used in the [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) 
desktop app. It's packaged using Hydraulic Conveyor, a tool for building and deploying native packages of JVM desktop apps that keep 
themselves fully up to date. You can use it as a template for your own modern looking and easy to install desktop apps.

## Jetpack Compose

Jetpack Compose is Androidâ€™s modern toolkit (now supporting Desktop) for building native UI. It simplifies and
accelerates UI development. Quickly bring your app to life with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.

## Credits

This app was originally written by [Gurupreet Singh](https://github.com/Gurupreet) for an early version of JetPack Compose. <a

It was ported to Compose 1.0 and the package config created by [Hydraulic](https://hydraulic.dev) to demonstrate how easy it is to 
write and update a slick JVM UI with modern tools.
